# Fraud detection

This repo will have several models for fraud detection

Dataset: [Kaggle Fraud detection 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/credit-card-fraud-detection-dataset-2023)

Note: Using XGBoost is enough in this project, but I want to take a step further. I will try every common ML/DL models avaliable to solve the problem.

### Avaliable models

* Logisitc
* Logistic + PCA
* XGBoost
* LightGBM
* FFN with Residual Connection
* Self-supervised VAEs (comming soon)
* Attention mechanism (comming soon)
